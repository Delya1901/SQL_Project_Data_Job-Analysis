# Background
Driven by the quest to navigate the data analyst job market more effectively, this project was born from a desire to pinpoint top-paid and in-demand skills, streamlining others work to find optimal jobs.

Data hails from [SQL course](https://lukebarousse.com/sql). It's packed with insights on job titles, salaries, locations, and essential skills.

### The questions I wanted to answer through my SQL queries were:

1. What are the top-paying data analyst jobs?
2. What skills are required for these top-paying jobs?
3. What skills are most in demand for data analysts?
4. Which skills are associated with higher salaries?
5. what are the most optimal skills to learn?

# Tools I used

For my deep dive into the data analyst job market I harnessed the power of several key tools:

- **SQL**: The backbone of my analysis, allowing me to query the database and unearth critical insaghts.
- **PostgreSQL**: The chosen database managemant system,ideal for handling the job posting data.
- **Visual Studio Code**: My go-to for database management and executing queries.
- **Git & GitHub**: Essential for version control and sharing my SQL scripts and analysis, ensuring collaboration and project tracking.
# The analysis

Each query for this project aimed at investigating specific aspects of the data analyst job market. Here's how I approched aech question:

### 1. Top Paying Data Analyst Jobs
To identify the highest-paying roles I filtered data analyst positions by average yearly salary and locaaiton, focusing on remote jobs. This query highlights the high paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT 
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name AS company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON 
    job_postings_fact.company_id= company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
    AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
    AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL

ORDER BY salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### 2. Skills for Top Paying Jobs  
To understand what skills are required for the top apying jobs, I joined the job postings with skill data, providing insights into what employers value for high-compensation roles.

```sql
WITH top_paying_jobs AS (
    SELECT 
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_title,
        salary_year_avg,
        job_posted_date,
        company_dim.name AS company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim ON 
        job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst'
        AND job_location = 'Anywhere'
        AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
)
SELECT 
    top_paying_jobs.*,
    skills_dim.skills
FROM top_paying_jobs
INNER JOIN skills_job_dim ON
    top_paying_jobs.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
INNER JOIN skills_dim ON
    skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
LIMIT 50;
```
Here's the breakdown of the most demanded skills for the top 10 highest paying data analyst jobs in 2023.
